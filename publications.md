**Abstract**  

  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.6;">
  Gyroid structures are increasingly being considered for biomedical applications due to their unique geometry, which allows for customizable mechanical and biological properties. In this study, gyroid structures made of Ti-6Al-4V were designed with varying pore sizes and wall thicknesses to evaluate their mechanical and fluid-flow characteristics. A 3D model of the gyroid was created using SolidWorks, and numerical simulations were conducted using ABAQUS and ANSYS Fluent to analyze the compression behavior and fluid flow characteristics. The results show that increasing wall thickness improves the mechanical properties, such as elastic modulus, yield strength, and ultimate tensile strength, while larger pore sizes reduce stiffness and strength. Mesh sensitivity studies identified an optimal mesh size of 0.2 mm for accurate simulations. Permeability and wall shear stress were evaluated using CFD simulations, revealing that larger pores and higher surface-to-volume ratios enhance permeability, while thicker walls increase wall shear stress. Experimental results were compared with simulation data to validate the models, showing a reasonable agreement in stress-strain behavior, although some discrepancies were observed, particularly in structures with more complex geometries. The energy absorption capacity of the gyroid structures was also assessed, with the 3-cell gyroid configuration demonstrating superior performance in both simulation and experimental tests. Overall, the study highlights the significant role of pore size, wall thickness, and cell configuration in optimizing the mechanical and biological properties of gyroid structures for use in bone implant applications.
