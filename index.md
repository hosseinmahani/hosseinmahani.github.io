## Research Interests
- Additive manufacturing (metal & polymer 3D printing)  
- Nanocomposites  
- Powder Processing  
- Materials characterization  
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA)

I am a mechanical engineer focused on **Additive Manufacturing (AM)** and advanced materials.  
My interests include **metal and polymer 3D printing**, process–structure–property relationships, and **nanocomposite** design.  
I enjoy translating research into practical solutions—**filament and powder development**, **DfAM**, and **process optimization**.  
Recent work covers **powder processing** chains, **PLA/TPS/nanoclay** bio-based systems, and AM component characterization.  
I’m also interested in **finite element analysis** for AM parts, linking simulation to experimental validation.  
My long-term goal is to develop reliable AM materials and workflows for **medical devices** and **lightweight structures**.
