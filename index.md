<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; line-height: 1.6;">
  I hold a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering and have specialized in additive manufacturing and material processing. My research includes two journal publications, and one ongoing publication related to metal 3D printing, in addition to holding two national patents in material processing and mechanical design. With over two years as a research assistant, I have honed my skills in data analysis, simulations, and proposing innovative methods for solving complex engineering challenges. I am also proficient in CAD and FEA tools, which support my work in 3D printing and material development. I have an IELTS score of 7 and GRE score of 315, which reflect my strong academic communication. As a passionate problem solver and researcher, I have learned that every problem is an opportunity for new discovery. I have led multiple academic projects and continue to push the boundaries of additive manufacturing, aiming to expand its application in engineering and biomedical fields.
